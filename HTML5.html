Click the starry squares to move around the grid and try to find the 4 treasures. If you encounter an enemy, click the 4 buttons with numbers under them to fight back. </br>This game is made with HTML5 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and is technically a webpage. The game functionality is coded exclusively in JavaScript. No Unity, no TypeScript. From this I also learned the necessity to plan my projects - even if it seems like something small on the surface.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://schriverdj87.github.io/spacetreasure/' target = '_blank'>Try It Out!</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/M68hcJEPZK8' target = '_blank'>Progress as of May 4th</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/srxe3xNUHCA' target = '_blank'>Progress as of May 25th</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>JSONGrind.html</h2> <a href = 'img/JSONGrind.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/JSONGrind.png'></div></a> <h3>Spring or Summer 2021</h3> <p>This became an essential tool for my team. JSONGrind.html converts JSON data stored in the database (without newlines) into readable tables when it is pasted into the "Paste JSON here" text field and the "Do It" button is clicked. Addionally, it will recognize documents such as invoices and orders in JSON format and render them appropriately complete with signaures. With the "TQF" button and text fields next to it, JSONGrind.html makes SQL queries with the JSON data useful for tracking down data in the database.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Higher or Lower</h2> <a href = 'img/horl.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/horl.png'></div></a> <h3>March 10 - 11, 2024</h3> <p>This is a simple application based on the <a href = "https://youtube.com/shorts/E8dVgNL_pNQ?si=wtMxi9S5W-sxQ8Kh" target = "_blank"> Tamagotchi number game </a> to get me familiarized with Typescript. You are presented with a number between 1 and 9 and you need to guess if the hidden number is higher or lower. The game ends with 3 wins or losses.</br> One of the challenges with this was getting it to work with an HTML file as what is generated with Typescript does not appear to be intended to do so in a simple manner. I came up with my own solution with Python called <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5n5KlXv0Vo" target = "_blank"> FIRMLYGRASPIT</a>.py (still a work in progress).</p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b>TypeScript, Python</p><h3><a href = 'apps/higherorlower/index.html' target = '_blank'>Try It Out!</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/higherorlower' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>UOM Application</h2> <a href = 'img/UOMApp.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/UOMApp.png'></div></a> <h3>Spring 2019</h3> <p>This application allows you to switch between and compare units of measurement.

This web application is useful to those in the know who want to use flexbox. The masks will shift and stretch as you play around with the drop menu options and numbers. You can add more masks by clicking the "Add Anon" and "Add Ronald" buttons and remove them by clicking the masks directly. This was initially made during college to help with my understanding of flexbox, but I found it to be a useful web design tool.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://dave9002.com/tools/FlexSampler/flexSampler.html' target = '_blank'>Try It Out!</a></h5></div>
