JSONGrind.html converts JSON data stored in the database (without newlines) into readable tables when it is pasted into the "Paste JSON here" text field and the "Do It" button is clicked. Addionally, it will recognize documents such as invoices and orders in JSON format and render them appropriately complete with signaures. With the "TQF" button and text fields next to it, JSONGrind.html makes SQL queries with the JSON data useful for tracking down data in the database.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Higher or Lower</h2> <a href = 'img/horl.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/horl.png'></div></a> <h3>March 10 - 11, 2024</h3> <p>This is a simple application based on the <a href = "https://youtube.com/shorts/E8dVgNL_pNQ?si=wtMxi9S5W-sxQ8Kh" target = "_blank"> Tamagotchi number game </a> to get me familiarized with Typescript. You are presented with a number between 1 and 9 and you need to guess if the hidden number is higher or lower. The game ends with 3 wins or losses.</br> One of the challenges with this was getting it to work with an HTML file as what is generated with Typescript does not appear to be intended to do so in a simple manner. I came up with my own solution with Python called <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5n5KlXv0Vo" target = "_blank"> FIRMLYGRASPIT</a>.py (still a work in progress).</p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b>TypeScript, Python</p><h3><a href = 'apps/higherorlower/index.html' target = '_blank'>Try It Out!</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/higherorlower' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>UOM Application</h2> <a href = 'img/UOMApp.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/UOMApp.png'></div></a> <h3>Spring 2019</h3> <p>This application allows you to switch between and compare units of measurement.

Makes it easier to make repetitive text. Template text goes onto the top bun with [REP] tags for the parts that change with each repetition. Create repetitions by entering elements into the bottom bun separated by commas. Output appears in the meat. Visual style was inspired by the work of Steve Moraff.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://dave9002.com/tools/templatesandwich.html' target = '_blank'>Try It Out!</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flIANnoyuFo' target = '_blank'>YouTube Demo</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Flex Sampler</h2> <a href = 'img/flexbox.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/flexbox.png'></div></a> <h3>March 21, 2018</h3> <p>Flexbox is a powerful facet of CSS for layouts on a website. This web application is useful to those in the know who want to use flexbox. The masks will shift and stretch as you play around with the drop menu options and numbers. You can add more masks by clicking the "Add Anon" and "Add Ronald" buttons and remove them by clicking the masks directly. This was initially made during college to help with my understanding of flexbox, but I found it to be a useful web design tool.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://dave9002.com/tools/FlexSampler/flexSampler.html' target = '_blank'>Try It Out!</a></h5></div>
