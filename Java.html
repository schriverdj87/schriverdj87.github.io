This program will take a folder containing folders of image files and generate an image gallery for them as a set of web pages. Additionally, you can caption the images by adding .txt files as long as they are in the same folder and have the same names as the images you want to caption (example: if you want to caption mario.png, add a text file named mario.txt in the same folder). </br> With the parameters file you can also change the number of images per web page, how many links are allowed on the navigation bar, the folder for the program to work with, whether or not you want a separate set of web pages for each folder within the working folder, and the names of the output files if you don't.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/autopicturegallerymaker' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/VyXjz1QjIkk' target = '_blank'>YouTube Demo</a></h5><h3><a href = 'misc/agmoutput/MyGallery1.html' target = '_blank'>Example Output</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Flash Cards</h2> <a href = 'img/flashcards.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/flashcards.png'></div></a> <h3>2016 - 2018</h3> <p>This program takes plain text and interprets it as quizzes for study purposes. Each line is interpreted as a question and each empty line is interpreted as a divider for a sub quiz. The quizzes can either be made with a text editor and saved to the "bucket" folder or entered into its onboard editor to its SQLite database. This was made before going to college and further developed through "field testing" where I found good use for it. My teacher for Intermediate Java allowed me to develop this for my final project. Please note that the version on GitHub is prior to the SQLite functionality to avoid potential legal issues.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/djSzZoiPffs' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/Flash-Cards-Java' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Neck</h2> <a href = 'img/neck.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/neck.png'></div></a> <h3>February 2017</h3> <p>A simple game that puts a twist on the classic snake game. Use the arrow keys to guide Naybur into the sparklies while avoiding skulls and his own neck. This made use of JavaFX's canvas functionality and required extra coding to get that retro look without blurring (anti-aliasing)</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyize1Bc_a4' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/neck' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h5></div>
