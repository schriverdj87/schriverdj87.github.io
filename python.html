These quizzes can have a wide range of questions including, true/false, matching, multiple choice, check all that apply and more. They can also include media including, videos, images, and sound. As with my previous study aid, quizzes are interpreted from plain text files. I made this because I couldn't simply share my previous Flashcards program which was a standalone application made with Java. </p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b> HTML5, JSON</p><h3><a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz-ozGbxTcI' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h3><h3><a href = 'quizzes/simplespellingtest.html' target = '_blank'>Quiz: Spelling Test</a></h3><h3><a href = 'quizzes/ports.html' target = '_blank'>Quiz: Ports</a></h3><h3><a href = 'quizzes/demo3.html' target = '_blank'>Quiz: Random</a></h3></div><div id = 'circle' class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Stay in the Circle</h2> <a href = 'img/circle.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/circle.png'></div></a> <h3>October - November 2024</h3> <p>A simple game made with pygame. As the name suggests, the goal of the game is to stay in the circle. Said circle will randomly speed up, shrink, change directions, and leave the screen to come out the other side. If the player can make it to 60 seconds they'll get the "good ending" This game features a separate presentation layer that uses pygame to handle audio, visuals, and player input and a "business" layer for the actual game which makes use of trigonometric functions and other logic and functions independently from pygame ensuring the potential for use with another game engine.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b> Pygame</p><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/stayinthecircle/' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h3><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/FC47SmcmpsQ' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h3></div><div id = 'sbmt' class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Starbound Modding Tools</h2> <a href = 'img/SBTools.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/SBTools.png'></div></a> <h3>~ August 2 2019</h3> <p>This is a set of tools for modding <a href = 'https://playstarbound.com/'>Starbound</a> complete with a demo for modding food allergies into the game.

I had initially planned on doing this with Java, but I was learning Python and decided to give it a try with Python instead. I found it to be easier in Python than it would have been with Java.
