The quizzes can either be made with a text editor and saved to the \"bucket\" folder or entered into its onboard editor to its SQLite database. This was made before going to college and further developed through \"field testing\" where I found good use for it. My teacher for Intermediate Java allowed me to develop this for my final project. Please note that the version on GitHub is prior to the SQLite functionality to avoid potential legal issues.",
