Additionally, you can caption the images by adding .txt files as long as they are in the same folder and have the same names as the images you want to caption (example: if you want to caption mario.png, add a text file named mario.txt in the same folder). </br> With the parameters file you can also change the number of images per web page, how many links are allowed on the navigation bar, the folder for the program to work with, whether or not you want a separate set of web pages for each folder within the working folder, and the names of the output files if you don't.",

The quizzes can either be made with a text editor and saved to the \"bucket\" folder or entered into its onboard editor to its SQLite database. This was made before going to college and further developed through \"field testing\" where I found good use for it. My teacher for Intermediate Java allowed me to develop this for my final project. Please note that the version on GitHub is prior to the SQLite functionality to avoid potential legal issues.",
