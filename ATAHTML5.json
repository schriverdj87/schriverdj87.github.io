If you encounter an enemy, click the 4 buttons with numbers under them to fight back. </br>This game is made with HTML5 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and is technically a webpage. The game functionality is coded exclusively in JavaScript. No Unity, no TypeScript. From this I also learned the necessity to plan my projects - even if it seems like something small on the surface.",
