In this way, it would be possible to copy the latter over to something like the Unity game engine for a more "gamer friendly" experience. </br>Either way, this project serves to prove that I can still dust off and make use of technology I haven't used in a while.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b> .NET</p><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/Yn1i0oNr-DQ' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h5><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/schriverdj87/monsterpunch' target = '_blank'>GitHub Repo</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Last Braincell</h2> <a href = 'img/lastbraincell.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/lastbraincell.png'></div></a> <h3>September 2018 - November 2018</h3> <p>The Last Braincell was a site for selling ideas such as becoming Batman or thinking one was a cow (boanthropy). It had user functionality including registration with verification, cart/checkout, and item creation. It also had an admin section for image handling and item creation. This was made alongside classmate Hoàng Nguyễn as a major college project.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p><b>Secondary Technologies:</b> ASP.NET, SQL</p><h3><a href = 'https://youtu.be/U0mM8JQCcPc' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Search by Contents</h2> <a href = 'img/search.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'img/search.png'></div></a> <h3>June 28 2021 - </h3> <p>Searches files by keywords by opening every and reading file in a given directory and pointing out the ones that contain the given phrase.

You start at 20 and you move around with WASD keys to make yourself 7 by catching the stylized suit cards that fly across the screen. Red cards (hearts, diamonds) make you decrease while black cards (spades, clubs) make you decrease. If you are 7 by the time the whole deck passes you win. If not or you become too high or too low you lose. If you win, the end screen will show you all the cards you collected. This was made in college for the object-oriented programming final project working with the limitations of windows forms. The name '7 Fingers' comes from a reference to a grizzly story from work safety class I was planning to add but (fortunately) didn’t. </p><p><ul><li>Created a card game using sophisticated C# coding and windows forms for an enjoyable user experience.</li><li>Designed minimalistic cards + backing using photo-manipulation software for a visually appealing look.</li><li>Recorded video demo and added 'on board' instructions for clarity.</li></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIpOp7j5fng' target = '_blank'>Demo on YouTube</a></h5></div>
