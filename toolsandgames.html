There is a white box that has a text field with code in it, A button that says "Layout as Deck", "Row Width" with a number box reading "5", a button that says "Layout as Grid", and a button that says shuffle.

                    <h3>Create and simulate a deck of cards.</h3>
                    <p>
                        A time-saver for those looking to develop card games (or money-saver for those who don't want to buy a physical game). Click the cheeseburger and enter your deck as plain text (within the app, instructions on how to do this will be in the console output, just press F12 and open the console tab).  Here's an example of a simple memory game: Memory|Apple:2|Banana:2|Grapes:2|Pear:2|Stinkbug:2. Then click “Layout as Deck” or “Layout as Grid” (latter for the example). Click a card once to flip it, click and drag to move it. Be advised that this does not work on mobile devices.

                    <h3>Interactively tinker with and see flexbox css rules in action.</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is an essential tool for anyone working with flexbox in front-end web design that I have used myself in various projects. Everything in green text is a CSS attribute that works with flexbox. Just play around with the drop down menus and number fields until you get what you're looking for then use that to write your CSS.

                    <h3>Continuously counts down and plays a sound at regular intervals.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Intended as an aid for those with attention problems, but is also useful as a reminder when something needs to be done at regular intervals. Just pick your settings including interval, sound played, and background, and click start. The application will display a timer against a scrolling background and will play a sound and start over when it reaches 0. Click anywhere to return to the menu. Be advised that it is ideal that this remains on screen as the browser may pause the program if it thinks it isn't in use.

                        Examples of where this would be useful would include making repetitive SQL queries separated by “union” or hard-coded repeating HTML elements. On the top bun write the template with [REP1] for the element that changes each time. On the bottom bun write the part that changes each time separated by commas. The meat and cheese shows the output.

Might be useful for clearing your head.
