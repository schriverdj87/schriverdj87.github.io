This was made for a "Manufacturing Fundamentals" course I took.This was made using GIMP and Inkscape. It was time consuming to flip through the pictures of the instructions on my phone and it was likely similarily inconvenient for my classmates; so I took my previous manager's advice and put my documentation skills to use. The result was a convenient document that my classmates were thrilled to get. This should make things more convenient for future students as well.</p><p><ul></ul></p><p></p><h3><a href = 'documentation/ViceCheatSheet2024_08_30.pdf' target = '_blank'>Download</a></h5></div><div class = 'toolitem fullishwidth'>  <h2>Flex Sampler Manual</h2> <a href = 'documentation/ThumbFlexSample.png' target = '_blank'><div class = 'portfolioImageDiv'><img src = 'documentation/ThumbFlexSample.png'></div></a> <h3>March 2025</h3> <p>A pdf detailing the how to use an application I made in college and continued to use through the years.
